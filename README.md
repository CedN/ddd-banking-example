# ddd-banking-example

Practice of DDD refactoring from [Carola Lilienthal](https://twitter.com/Cairolali)'s '[ddd-banking-example](https://github.com/lilienth/ddd-banking-example)' workshop.

The main branch contains the legacy code and the 'refactoring' branch contains the refactored code. Every step has a commit.

Works in progress :)
